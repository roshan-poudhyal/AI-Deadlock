## 📚 Overview

**AI-Deadlock** is an intelligent system designed to **predict, detect, and resolve deadlocks** in concurrent processes using Artificial Intelligence techniques.  
It enhances traditional deadlock detection by integrating ML models and graph-based algorithms, offering a smarter and faster solution.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 **Deadlock Detection**: Analyze system states and identify deadlocks.
- 🧠 **AI Prediction**: Forecast potential deadlocks before they occur.
- 🔄 **Resolution Strategies**: Suggest methods to recover from deadlocks.
- 📈 **Optimized Algorithms**: Uses efficient resource allocation and graph traversal techniques.
- 📊 **Logging and Monitoring**: Tracks deadlock events and system responses.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - NetworkX (for graph modeling)
  - Scikit-learn (for ML models)
  - Pandas, NumPy (for data manipulation)
- **Concepts**:
  - Deadlock detection using Resource Allocation Graphs (RAG)
  - Machine Learning based prediction
  - Process scheduling and resource management
